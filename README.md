# Discrepancy-Match
I wanted to work on a project to practice lots of aspects of Python and programming. I also wanted something meaningful. This project covers both those fields for me

## Purpose of the Tool
At my work (not tech related) I had to create an excel template to match up similarities between multiple reports. I built these templates using VBA. I am now building a GUI in python with the same functionality so the teams around me can do this without having to copy and paste into Excel (lots of room for error there!)

## What this tool does?
This tool allows the user to make a choice between Eclipse or Novar which are systems that provide different reports. They then choose what report they want. Then they will load up the Discrepancy report and the report they want to match it up with. They then hit Submit and the software will compare the reports and provide the output. They will have the option to open directly, or to save for later use.
